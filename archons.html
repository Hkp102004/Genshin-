                really kind and gentle archon who never ruled the people 
                but instead let them be comepletly free and enjoy the 
                freedom. The people of mondstadth still never forget to

                split mountails. He can control the wind but nowadays he just

                She is a kind god who takes care of her people but for fontaine she is more of a star than a god. In Fontaine she lives
                with the people where people treat her like a star insted of a god. Since Fontaine is the nation of Justice. The coart of
                Fontaine works every day and everyone goes to see the trail as their enetertainment and then the court is also used for 
                functions and celebrations and also shows. Furina is one of the biggest star there but Fontains used to live under the 
                prophesy that one day the primordial sea water will flow and fontaine will flood, every human will drown and the nation will be 
                destroyed while the archon will sit on her throne crying. The prophesy happened and the nation managed to survive cause 
                of Furina's sacrifice. Furina She fooled the heavely principles. Furina is actially a human who played the role of archon for
                500 years. The real archon Focelore made Furina and told her to keep it a secret and act as am archon. Furina suffred for 500 years
